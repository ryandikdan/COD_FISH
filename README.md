# COD_FISH

This repository contains the code for running COD_FISH, the smFISH probe designer. To run, it must be in a windows or mac computer, then all of the files must be downloaded into a directory and the command `python gui_COD_FISH.py` will open up the GUI or the `python COD_FISH.py` command run the command line version of the program. To avoid using the command line at all. You can download the appropriate zip file (windows or mac) and then double click the gui_COD_FISH.exe (windows) or gui_COD_FISH (mac) file and it should open the GUI and a terminal for progress.
